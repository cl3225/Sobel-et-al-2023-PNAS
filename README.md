# Sobel-et-al.-2023-PNAS
Codes & data for conducting analysis in Sobel et al. 2023. We use SST from Hadley SST as an example, but one can swap the data with SST or track density from CMIP6 or HighResMIP.  Input data is the HadISST_sobel_etal_2023PNAS.nc Analysis codes are originally written by Naomi Henderson for Seager et al. (2019, 2022)
